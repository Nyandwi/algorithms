### Algorithm Design Manual 

* *Author: Steven S. Skienna*
* *Goal: Read the book end to end*
* *The notes are very brief. It's important things that I want to retain from the book.*

Notes:
* Algorithm design is one of the core practical techonologies of computer science. 
* Good algorithm design require understanding several fundamental algorithm design technique including data structures, dynamic programming, depth-first search, backtracking and heuristics. 
* The single most important design technique is modelling - the art of abstracting a messy real-world applications into a clean problem suitable for algorithmic attack. 
* Great algo designers stands on the shoulder of the giant. Rather than building every algorithm from scratch, they build up on existing algorithms to build new algorithms. 
* It's important to be familiar with classical algorithms.
