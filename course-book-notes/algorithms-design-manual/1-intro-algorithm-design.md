## 1. Introduction to Algorithm Design

 * Algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task. It is a procedure that takes any of the possible input instances and transforms it to the desired output. 
 * Algorithm must solve a general and well specified problem. 
 * Algorithm problem is specified by describing the complete set of instances it must work on and of its output after running on one of these instances. 
 * Example of algorithmic problem: Given an array of values, return the array with sorted values...
 * The 3 main traits of a good algrithm: correctness, efficient, and easy implementation.
 * Correctness is an important property of the algorithm. Algorithm must correctly solve the presented problem.
