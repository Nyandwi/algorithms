## Technical Questions


* Don't just read questions and solutions. Practice solving them, memorization won't help. 

### How to prepare:
* Try solving problem on your own. When solving a problem, think about time and space efficiency. 
* Write the code on paper.
* Test your code on paper: general cases, edge cases, corner cases, error cases. You will need to do this in interview anyways. 

*Need to know: The sorts of dat structure ad algorithms questions that many companies ask are not knowledge based, but assume a baseline of knowledge.*

### Must know: Core data structures, algorithms, and concepts. 

Data structures:
    - Linked lists
    - Trees, Tries, Graphs
    - Stacks & Queues
    - Heaps
    - Vectors/ArraysLists
    - Hash tables(very important!!!)

Algorithms:
    - Breadth-First-Search
    - Depth-First-Search
    - Binary Search
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort

Concepts:
    - Bit manipulation
    - Memory(stack vs. Heap)
    - Recursion
    - Dynamic Programming
    - Big O Time & space


* It's rare that you will be asked to implement those things. But know their basics and try to implement them on your own. Also think about time and space complexity.
* Also know the power 2. Below is the table..It's useful for questions involving scalability or any sort of memory limitation.

### Walking through the code

* Listen: pay close attention to any info about the problem. 
* Get a brute force solution ASAP. but don't code it yet. Don't be afraid to share it. 
* Optimize the brute force and get a better solution. Try to think about time vs space complexity. 
* Walk through the approach in the detail and make sure you understand it before coding. 
* Implement the code. The goal is to write beautiful code. 
* Test the code. Walkthrough the code like you would for a detailed code review. 
* Keep talking. Your interviewer want to know how you are interviewing.

##### Listen carefully:

* Make sure you hear the problem correctly.
* Ask questions where you are not sure.
* Listen carefully!!!
* Takes a notes on the whiteboard.
* Make a time and space trade-off.
  
##### Optimizing a solution after you have a brute force:
* look for any unused information and leverage them. If interviewer said array is sorted, then you can make the use of such information. 
* Solve it incorrectly. An inneficient solution can lead to efficient solution. 
* Make time vs space trade-offs. 
* Use hash tables. They are widely used in interview and should be on top of your mind. 
  
##### Walk through...
* Understand the problem before coding. 
* Don't write pseudocode. Just write steps lile 1: search array, 2:find biggest, 3: insert in heap, etc...
  

*****WRITE BETTER CODE*****

#### What good code looks like:
* Good code should operate correctly on all expected ad unexpected inputs. 
* The code should operate efficiently in terms of both time and space. 
* Good code are simple. If you can do something in 1 lines of code than 10, do it!
* Good codes are readable, add comments wherever necessary. 
* Good code should me maintainable. 

More traits of good code:
* Modularized. Divide codes into chunks for easy testing. 
* Flexible and robust. 
* Error handling. 

#### To do:
* Read this chapter again
* Read Big O
* Move to questions ASAP
