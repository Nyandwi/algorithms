# Algorithms and Data Structures for Machine Learning Interviews

I want to learn algorithms and data structures to improve my SE skills as I do not have a background in computer science. I will use this repository to track my progress, take notes, and to practice.

Algorithms and data structures are important for not only getting around the coding interviews but also for solving algorithmic problems efficiently(time and space complexity wise). Every program that exists is a tree or a flow of operations that executes particular instructions. Every program takes or produces data. There are different types of data, each type require different manipulation and storage techniques. That's exactly why I would like to learn about data structures and algorithms.

### Acknowledgements

The notes about algorithms and data structures are the most important takeaways from the mentioned primary resources. Some lines/ideas revised in notes may be completely similar or closely connected as this repo was done for learning purpose and to act as a reference for my progress. Same thing for implementations of those algorithms and data structures.

Thanks to my friend Gedeon Muhawenayo for supporting my learning journey, reviewing materials in this repository and suggesting good resources for Algorithms.
