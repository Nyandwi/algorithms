## Algorithms and Data Structures in Python

I want to learn algorithms and data structures to improve my SE skills. I will use this repository to keep track of my progress, to practice, and learn.

Algorithms and data structures are also important for not only getting around the coding interviews but also for thinking like a programmer in general. Every program that exists is a tree or a flow of operations that executes particular instructions. Every program that exists takes or produces data. There are different types of data, each type require different manipulation and storage techniques.

Why not learn how to effectively handle such data? Why not learn how to control the flow of the program effectively? That why I thought it would be cool to learn about algorithms and data structures.

### Primary Resources

* Course: MIT Introduction to Algorithms, [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA-tUyM_y7s&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63EdVPNLG3ToM6LaEUuStEY), [Website](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/)
* LeetCode Algorithms and DS questions
* Book: Algorithms Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena
* Book: Cracking Coding Interviews
  

Other Resources that I will probably don't use:
* Book: Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Michael T. Goodrich
* [Princeton Algorithms and Data Structures](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne..There is also a Coursera course on this. 
* Course: Data Structures and Algorithms in Python on Free Code Camp, [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA), [Website](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python)
