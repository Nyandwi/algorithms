## Algorithms and Data Structures in Python

I want to learn algorithms and data structures to improve my SE skills. I will use this repository to track my progress, take notes, and to practice.

Algorithms and data structures are important for not only getting around the coding interviews but also for solving algorithmic problems efficiently(time and space complexity wise). Every program that exists is a tree or a flow of operations that executes particular instructions. Every program takes or produces data. There are different types of data, each type require different manipulation and storage techniques. That's exactly why I would like to learn about data structures and algorithms.

### Revised Algorithms

* [Quick Sort](algorithms/quick-sort.py), [About Quick Sort](algorithms/quick-sort.md)
* [Merge Sort](algorithms/merge-sort.py), [About Merge Sort](algorithms/merge-sort.md)
* [Heap Sort](algorithms/heap-sort.py), [About Heap Sort](algorithms/heap-sort.md)
* [Binary Search](algorithms/binary-search.py), [About Binary Search](algorithms/binary-search.md)
* Breadth-first Search
* Depth-first Search

### Revised Data Structures

* Linked lists
* Trees, Tries, [Graphs](data-structures/graphs-intro.md)
* Stacks and Queues
* Heaps
* Vectors/ArrayLists
* Hash tables!!!

### Revised Concepts

* Recursion
* Dynamic Programming
* Big O - time and space complexity
* Bit manipulation
* Memory(stack vs heap)

### Other Things to Learn Along

* [Python - Basics](https://github.com/Nyandwi/python_basics), Revise it!!
* Python - Advanced, TBD
* Maths for ML, TBD
* ML System Design, Later
