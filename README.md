# Algorithms and Data Structures for Coding Interviews

I want to learn algorithms and data structures to improve my SE skills as I do not have a background in computer science. I will use this repository to track my progress, take notes, and to practice.

Algorithms and data structures are important for not only getting around the coding interviews but also for solving algorithmic problems efficiently(time and space complexity wise). Every program that exists is a tree or a flow of operations that executes particular instructions. Every program takes or produces data. There are different types of data, each type require different manipulation and storage techniques. That's exactly why I would like to learn about data structures and algorithms.

### Acknowledgements

The notes about algorithms and data structures are the most important takeaways from the mentioned primary resources. I tried to take simplified notes and added extra ideas wherever necessary, but some lines/ideas may be completely similar or closely connected to those resources. This repo was done for learning purpose and to act as a reference. Same thing for implementations of those algorithms and data structures.

Thanks to my friend Gedeon Muhawenayo for his support on reviewing materials in this repository and suggesting good resources for Algorithms.
