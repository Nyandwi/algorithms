# Algorithms and Data Structures for Coding Interviews

I want to learn algorithms and data structures to improve my engineering skills. I will use this repository to track my progress, take notes, and to practice.

Algorithms and data structures are two of the most important computer science concepts. They are not only important for getting around the coding interviews but also for solving computational problems efficiently. To day, there are massive datasets that are being generated instantly. Developing efficient algorithms that work on those massive datasets is one of the key and biggest challenges for almost every engineer. Choosing a right algorithm and data structure that suit a particular computation problem is also a critical thing that can influence the efficiency of the program.

### Acknowledgements

The notes about algorithms and data structures are the most important takeaways from the mentioned primary resources. I tried to take simplified notes and added extra ideas wherever necessary, but some lines/ideas may be completely similar or closely connected to those resources. This repo was done for learning purpose and to act as a reference. Same thing for implementations of those algorithms and data structures.

Thanks to my friend Gedeon Muhawenayo for reviewing materials in this repository and suggesting good resources for algorithms.
