## Heap Sort

* Heap sort is the implementation of selection sort in a heap data structure. It is an inplace sorting algorithm.
* Selection sort is the most basic sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The remaining elements are then sorted in non-decreasing order.(Definition by Copilot).
* Heap sort is an in-place algorithm.
* The time complexity of heap sort is O(nlogn).  The space complexity of heap sort is O(1).
* Heaps simple and powerful data structure that support the priority queue operations and insert and delete operations - and extract min as well - something that we want to do in heap sort.
