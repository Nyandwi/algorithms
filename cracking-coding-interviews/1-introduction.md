## Cracking Coding Interviews

## Introduction

>And remember, interviews are hard. Getting easy questions doesn't make it any easier to get the offer. Receiving an offer is not about solving questions flawlessly(very few people do!). Rather, it is about answering the questions better than other candidates. So, don't stress out when you get a tricky question - Everyone else probably though it was hard too. It's okay to not be flawless.

`Study hard, practice`.

* To crack the coding interview, you need to prepare with real interview questions. You must practice on real problems and learn their patterns. It's about developing a fresh algorithm, not memorizing the existing problems. 

The focus of the book is algorithm, coding and design questions. 

### Interview Process

* Algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process. They are problem solving questions. The interviewer is looking to evaluate your ability to solve algorithmic problems you haven't seen before. 
  
* You should do your best to talk out loud throughout the problem and explain your thoughful process. 

* Main things that are accessed during interview: 

    * Analytical skills: How optimal the solution is, how long it took to solve a problem, trade-offs of different decisions, etc...
    * Coding skills: Can you translate your algorithm into reasonable code? Was it clean and organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style? 

    * Technical knouledge/CS fundamentals: Do you have a strong foundation in Cs and relevant technologies? 
    * Experience: Have you made a good technical decision in the past? Have you built an interesting and challenging project? Have you shown drive, initiative, abd other important factors? 
    * Culture fit/communication skills: Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

Why Interviews are the way they are: Some interview mindset insights: 

* For company perspective, false positives are acceptable. They are far more concerned with people who do well in an interview but are in fact not very good. 
* Problems solving are valuable. If you are able to solve hard problems, you are probably pretty good at developing algorithms. You're smart. 
* Data structures and algorithms are important skills. You may not need to use trees, graphs, lists, sorting, and others but that doesn't mean they are not useful. 
* Whiteboards lets you focus on what's matter. You can focus on a big picture if you are not worried about compiling the codes and the output. Don't write pseudocode though. Whitebord also tend to encourage candidates to speak more and explain their thought process. 
* Interview questions don't measure someone's work ethic or ability to focus. And no interview process can evaluate this. All interview processes have their downsides. `It is what it is, so let's do the best we can with it`. 


* In many companies, each interviewer selects their own questions. The question asked at Google this year don't differ from those asked three years ago. The question asked at Google generally don't differ from those asked at Facebook. 
* Some companies focus on algorithms and system design and others really like knouledge based questions. 
* A Google algorithm is essentially the same as Facebook algorithm question. 

* It's all relative. You are compared to all other interviewees in the same round. If the question is harder for you, it's harder for everyone. It doesn't make it any less likely that you will do well. 

* Can I apply again at same company if I am rejected? Yes, after 6-1 year. 
  
### Behind the Scene

* Once you are selected for interview, you usually go through screening interview, typicallly over phone. But it can be technical!!!
* In an onsite interview round, you usually go through 3-6 interviews. One is not technical but others are and involves coding, algorithm, design,/architecture, and behavioral questions. 

Microsoft interview:
* Why do you want to work at MS? 

Amazon Interviews: 
* Amazon cares about scale >> Scalability questions
* Also tests about object oriented design. 

Google interview: 
* Google care about how to design a scalable system
* Google puts a strong focus on analytical(algorithm) skills 
  
Apple interviews: 
* Excellent technical skills 
* Passion for tech and company
* Why do you like the tech? team? 

Facebook Interview: 
* Entrepreneurial sprit. 
* They want to know you can hack together an elegant and scalable solution. 

### Special Situations 

***Some important ideas about specific roles, acquisation, etc..:***

### Before the Interview

* Without a great resume, there's no interview. And without great experience, there's no great resume. ThereÂ­ fore, the first step in landing an interview is getting great experience. The further in advance you can think about this the better.

* For students: take the big project classes, get an internship, build something. 

* Resume screeners look for same things in your resume. They want to know that you're smart and you can code. That means you should prepare your resume to highlight those two things.
* Resume: Only one page. 2-4 projects....
* "Learn the second different language. Where possible, try to truly diversify. The languages in the cluster of {Python, Ruby, and JavaScript} are somewhat similar to each other. It's better if you can learn languages that are more different, like Python, C++, and Java."

* Reread the section again and again.
