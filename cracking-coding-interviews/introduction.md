## Cracking Coding Interviews

## Introduction

>And remember, interviews are hard. Getting easy questions doesn't make it any easier to get the offer. Receiving an offer is not about solving questions flawlessly(very few people do!). Rather, it is about answering the questions better than other candidates. So, don't stress out when you get a tricky question - Everyone else probably though it was hard too. It's okay to not be flawless.

`Study hard, practice`.

* To crack the coding interview, you need to prepare with real interview questions. You must practice on real problems and learn their patterns. It's about developing a fresh algorithm, not memorizing the existing problems. 

The focus of the book is algorithm, coding and design questions. 

### Interview Process

* Algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process. They are problem solving questions. The interviewer is looking to evaluate your ability to solve algorithmic problems you haven't seen before. 
  
* You should do your best to talk out loud throughout the problem and explain your thoughful process. 

* Main things that are accessed during interview: 

    * Analytical skills: How optimal the solution is, how long it took to solve a problem, trade-offs of different decisions, etc...
    * Coding skills: Can you translate your algorithm into reasonable code? Was it clean and organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style? 

    * Technical knouledge/CS fundamentals: Do you have a strong foundation in Cs and relevant technologies? 
    * Experience: Have you made a good technical decision in the past? Have you built an interesting and challenging project? Have you shown drive, initiative, abd other important factors? 
    * Culture fit/communication skills: Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?
